# CAUTION:  Installing a new version of FreeS/WAN will install a new
# copy of this script, wiping out any custom changes you make.  If
# you need changes, make a copy of this under another name, and customize
# that, and use the (left/right)updown parameters in ipsec.conf to make
# FreeS/WAN use yours instead of this default one.

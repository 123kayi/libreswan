Basic pluto X.509 test from x509-pluto-01, but now
west and east are dropped UDP fragments, and our policies forbid
IKE fragmentation. The CERT payload is causing an IKE payload of
more then 1500 bytes, so the UDP packet will be fragmented.

As a result, this connection should fail to establish. This serves
as a basis for our IKE fragmentation tests that work around the
iussie of routers dropping UDP fragments.

Using a single VTI device for all incoming roadwarriors on a connection

this needs an updown that east could run that installs the VTI device and
routes into the VTI device. For now, eastinit.sh creates the device
and the route has to be done manually

WIP: currently road's pings will come in on east's VTI and get a reply
but the reply won't get encrypted.

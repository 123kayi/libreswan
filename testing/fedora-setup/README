This is work in progress - use a disposable system :/
Be aware this requires running a libvirtd to crate the networks
and a qemu/kvm to create the first base image on which all umls
are based.


- Ensure all nic's user "virtio" and not "hypervisor-default". Double
  check this setting for all nics, and remember "apply" only applies to
  one screen/nic, not all changed you made.

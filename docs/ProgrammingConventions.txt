Notes on Pluto Conventions
==========================

Pluto previously had it's own stylistic conventions but they were
abandoned and starting from Libreswan 3.4 only Linux Kernel coding style
is accepted.

Please read the Coding Style document thorougly.

- don't use malloc/free -- use the wrappers (see defs.h)

- you can use checkpatch.pl utility from kernel to check your patches
  before committing.

  git diff | checkpatch.pl --no-tree --no-signoff -

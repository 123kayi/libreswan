			Openswan 2.3.1 Release Notes

Openswan is based on code from the FreeS/WAN project (www.freeswan.org)
It has support for most of the extensions (RFC + IETF drafts) related
to IPsec, including X.509 Digital Certificates, NAT Traversal, and many 
others.

Openswan was originally based on FreeS/WAN 2.04 CVS, along with some
minor bug fixes from 2.05 and 2.06.  See CREDITS for the history.

				REQUIREMENTS

Linux Kernel 2.4.x, or 2.6.x are the currently supported platforms

There a few packages required for Openswan to compile:

1. libgmp + libgmp-devel headers.  (GNU Math Precision Library)

2. flex, and bison (usually included in all distributions)

# HOW TO INSTALL on Kernel 2.6 (And Kernels with 2.6 IPsec backport)
#########################################################################

For Linux Kernels 2.6.0 and higher, Openswan can use the built in IPsec
support.  Only the userland component of Openswan is required when using a
2.6 series kernel.  Please use at least version 2.6.6, as prior versions
of the kernel have serious bugs in the IPsec stack.

1.0)	From the openswan source directory:

	make programs

2.0)	As root, install the userland tools:

	make install

Note: The ipsec-tools package is no longer needed. Instead iproute2 >= 2.6.8
is required. For backport'ed kernels, setkey and thus ipsec-tools might still
be required. Run 'ipsec verify' to determine if your system has either one
of the requirements.

# HOW TO INSTALL on Linux Kernel 2.4 systems
#########################################################################

0.0)	The following instructions assume the kernel source tree is in 
	/usr/src/linux-2.4.  If this isn't the case, simply change the 
	parameters in the instructions below.

1.0) 	Uncompress linux-2.#.#.tar.bz2 in /usr/src (or elsewhere), build a 
	normal working kernel.  This ensures any compiliation problems 
	that occur are isolated and resolved *before* any Openswan patches 
	are applied to the kernel.

1.1)	If you want NAT-T support, you need to patch your kernel and build
	a new bzImage.  From the Openswan source directory:

	make nattpatch | (cd /usr/src/linux-2.4 && patch -p1 && make bzImage)
	
	Note: Build and install kernel as normal, as you have modified
	the TCP/IP stack in the kernel, so it needs to be recompiled and
	installed.

        eg: cd /usr/src/linux && make dep bzImage install



2.0)	From the openswan source directory, build the userland tools, and
	ipsec.o kernel module:

	make KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux-2.4 programs module

3.0)	As root, install the userland tools, and the ipsec.o module:

	make KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux-2.4 install minstall


				UPGRADING

1. If you are upgrading from a 1.x product to Openswan 2.x, you will
need to adjust your config files.  See doc/upgrading.html for details
on what has changed.

2. You can 'make install' overtop of your old version - it won't replace
your /etc/ipsec.* config files

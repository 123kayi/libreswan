The "ng-patch" is a collection of patches to the kernel to allow for
multiple tunnels using the same virtual ip. This is required to support
L2TP which uses IPsec transport mode, where there are multiple clients
behind one NAT, or multiple clients with the same IP before NAT, or
any combination thereof.

See doc/ipsecsaref.png for a graphical explanation of this scenario.

It adds a reference number to each IPsec tunnel, so we can distinguish
identical IP addresses on different tunnels.

A few important notes:

1) We hope to get this patch integrated into the mainstream kernel, so
   that we don't have to worry about the IP_IPSEC_REFINFO clashing with
   other IN_* defines in linux/in.h

2) the IP_IPSEC_REFINFO is also defined in xl2tpd. These two need to
   match! We have currently picked 22 for this.

3) Currently, IPsec SAref tracking does not work together with kernel
   L2TP mode included in 2.6.23

4) The IPsec SAref code requires the support of "fwmask" in the userland
   utility "ip" as well, so a patch to the iproute2 package is required
   as well. We hope to fold this into the main iproute2 package as well.

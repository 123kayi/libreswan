I propose the following proceedure.
  
Releases are numbered M.X.Y.

During Y==0 releases, we may introduce new functionality.
       These releases are to be considered "testing" (in debian parlance)
       
During Y!=0 releases, we may not introduce new functionality, and these
       releases are to be considered "stable" (in debian parlance).

Releases where X==0 are to be considered "unstable". We reserve the
	 right to replace entire subsystems, remove functionality, 
	 change configuration file formats, etc.

So, this means that the current #public/2.5.0drY branch shall henceforth
be called "3.0.Y".  We will not do "drX" or "rcX" releases to the public.    

The digits "Y" may go as large as 99. We will do a new X or Y-level release 
4 times a year, possibly more often if we need to fix bugs.

Probably there were two new X-level releases among the 2.4.Y path
which we could have done.

The message to Fedora and Debian should be:

1) include Y==0 releases in "testing" at your discretion.

2) there is no significant functional changes or stability changes
   between M.X.Y and M.X+1.Y, for Y!=0. 

   Setting Y=0 is a sign that we may have refactored or revised some
   piece of the system, and we are indicating caution.  Users should
   be able to trust that M.X+1.Y, Y>=1 will be a drop-in replacement for
   M.X.Y.

We will try to always do a M.X.1 release within 2 months of a M.X.0
release.  Those are to be considered stable.

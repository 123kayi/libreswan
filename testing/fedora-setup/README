This is work in progress - use a disposable system :/
Be aware this requires running a libvirtd to crate the networks
and a qemu/kvm to create the first base image on which all umls
are based.


- Ensure all nic's user "virtio" and not "hypervisor-default". Double
  check this setting for all nics, and remember "apply" only applies to
  one screen/nic, not all changed you made.

- Ensure the "testing" directory from this tree is world readable.
  including any parent directories. So if this is in your homedir,
  then your homedir needs to be world readable. Or else the /testing
  directory cannot be exported to the VMs

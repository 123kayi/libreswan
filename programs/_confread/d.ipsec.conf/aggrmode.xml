<para>Use Aggressive Mode instead of Main Mode. Aggressive Mode is less secure,
and vulnerable to Denial Of Service attacks. It is also vulnerable to brute force
attacks with software such as <emphasis remap='B'>ikecrack</emphasis>. It should
not be used, and it should especially not be used with XAUTH and group secrets (PSK).
If the remote system administrator insists on staying irresponsible, enable this option.</para>
<para>Aggressive Mode is further limited to only one proposal - there is no room for
negotation. Therefor it is mandatory for Aggressive Mode connections that both
<emphasis remap='B'>ike=</emphasis> and <emphasis remap='B'>phase2alg=</emphasis> options are
specified with exactly one fully specified proposal.
Acceptable values are <emphasis remap='B'>yes</emphasis> or <emphasis remap='B'>no</emphasis>
(the default).</para>
<para>
The ISAKMP SA is created in exchange 1 in aggressive mode. Openswan has to send the exponent
during that exchange, so it has to know what DH group to use before starting. This is why you
can not have multiple DH groups in aggressive mode. It also has to pick which has to use
since it needs to know which PRF to use to generate keys - in IKEv1 the hash negotiated
is really the PRF. In concept, Openswan could perhaps propose 3DES and AES128 in aggressive mode,
but this needs to be verified and is currently not supported.

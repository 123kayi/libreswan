An interop test of Authenticated Header (AH) using sha2_512

This uses IKEv1. It requires netkey

This test requires strongswan 5.1.1 or newer for AH support.

But it requires strongswan < 5.5.2 because there they broke it :/

| PROTO AH: we should check registration of attrs->transattrs.integ_hash=5
"westnet-eastnet-ikev1" #2: AUTH_ALGORITHM_HMAC_SHA2_256 attribute inappropriate in AH_AES_XCBC_MAC Transform
| complete v1 state transition with BAD_PROPOSAL_SYNTAX

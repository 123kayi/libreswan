This tests a mismatch of transport vs tunnel mode.

The RFC says that if transport is not supported, tunnel should be used.

libreswan refuses to use tunnel mode when transport mode is configured, to
avoid connections that work only when one specific side is the initiator.

Since libreswan initiates with tunnel mode, and strongswan accepts tunnel
mode when configured for transport mode, the connection establishes.
i
when this connection would be initiated by strongswan, the connection would fail.

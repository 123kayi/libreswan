pluto RSA test in FIPS mode using default IKE parameters and IKEv1

East is placed in fips mode, allowing for tests of non-fips proposals by west

This test requires compilation with USE_FIPSCHECK=true
This test requires installing by rpm so the .hmac FIPS verification passes
This test fakes the kernel being in FIPS mode
This test uses NSS modutil to put NSS explicitely in FIPS mode

This test also uses plutodebug=all,private to test that private does not
break things (we cannot access key material to log via private calls)

The default proposal contains MD5 which is not allowed in FIPS mode. This should
not affect the default proposal other than not using the the MD5 proposals.

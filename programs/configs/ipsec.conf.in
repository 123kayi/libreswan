# basic configuration
config setup
	# which IPsec stack to use, "netkey" (the default), "klips" or "mast". For OSX use "bsd"
	protostack=netkey
	#
	# The interfaces= line is only required for the klips stack
	#interfaces="%defaultroute"
	#interfaces="ipsec0=eth0 ipsec1=ppp0"
	#
	# If you want to limit listening on a single IP - not required for normal operation
	#listen=127.0.0.1
	#
	# Do not set debug options to debug configuration issues!
	# plutodebug / klipsdebug = "all", "none" or a combation from below:
	# "raw crypt parsing emitting control klips pfkey natt x509 dpd private"
	# eg:
	#plutodebug="control parsing"
	# Again: only enable plutodebug or klipsdebug when asked by a developer
	#plutodebug=none
	#klipsdebug=none
	#
	# Normally, pluto logs via syslog. If you want to log to a file, specify below
	# or to disable logging, eg for embedded systems, use the file /dev/null
	#plutostderrlog=/var/log/pluto.log
	#
	# Enable core dumps (might require system changes, like ulimit -C)
	# This is required for abrtd to work properly
	# Note: SElinux policies might prevent pluto writing the core at unusual locations
	dumpdir=/var/run/pluto/
	#
	# NAT-TRAVERSAL support, see README.NAT-Traversal
	# exclude networks used on server side by adding %v4:!a.b.c.0/24
	# It seems that T-Mobile in the US and Rogers/Fido in Canada are
	# using 25/8 as "private" address space on their wireless networks.
	# This range has not been announced via BGP (at least upto 2010-12-21)
	nat_traversal=yes
	virtual_private=%v4:10.0.0.0/8,%v4:192.168.0.0/16,%v4:172.16.0.0/12,%v4:25.0.0.0/8,%v6:fd00::/8,%v6:fe80::/10

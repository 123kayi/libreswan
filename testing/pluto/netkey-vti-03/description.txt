WIP:

using marking and VTI, map two IPsec SA's onto one VTI device that use a different
set of gateway IPs. This would function similarly to the old KLIPS ipsec0 device.

Currently: a ping from east to west on either subnet results in ESP packets on the
nic (swan12) but the packets from west to east are missing on the ipsec0 interface
on west. East also does not see ping replies but also does not log xfrm drops.
West shows icmp reply/request on the ipsec0 interface

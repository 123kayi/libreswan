addconn failing in libreswan upto 3.21 in specific scenarios
(maybe only when too many host routes?)

west is not really used

The connection on east should succeed to load.

The issue is likely related to receiving large netlink messages.
The code that is triggering the failure is in programs/addconn/addconn.c
around line 176:

                if (!NLMSG_OK(nlhdr, (unsigned short)readlen) ||
                        nlhdr->nlmsg_type == NLMSG_ERROR)
                        return -1;

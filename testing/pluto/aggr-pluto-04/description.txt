An aggressive mode test where east emulates an old Cisco that only
allows MODP1024 and MODP1536. West uses an ike= line without modp
group so it gets the default list that contains MODP2048.

In libreswan-3.10 it caused the connection to fail. In libreswan-3.11,
the order in IKEv1 is changed so MODP1536 is tried first. The test
than passes

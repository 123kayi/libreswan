			Openswan 2.0.0 Release Notes

Openswan is based on code from the FreeS/WAN project (www.freeswan.org)
It has support for most of the extensions (RFC + IETF drafts) related
to IPsec, and includes X.509 Digital Certificates

The release was based on FreeS/WAN 2.04 CVS, along with some minor bug fixes, 
it also includes Andreas Steffan's X.509 Digital Certificate patch.

				REQUIREMENTS


We do not support obsolete kernels (e.g. 2.2.xx, xx < 20), and using them 
is generally a bad idea anyway due to known security holes.

We do not test with 2.0 kernels earlier than 2.0.39.

A number of folks have reported problems where pluto and/or whack don't
compile properly.  As well if you upgraded over top of another FreeS/WAN
installation, you may see errors like this:

ipsec__plutorun: /usr/local/lib/ipsec/whack: option `--ike' is ambiguous 

Or pfkey read/write errors.  These indicate mismatched versions of the 
Openswan userland tool, and the kernel module.

There a few packages required for Openswan to compile:

1. libgmp + libgmp-devel headers.  (GNU Math Precision Library)

2. On RedHat 7.x systems, kernel-headers 2.4.9-34 or higher.  2.4.7-10 is
broken, and you will see __fswab32 errors during compilation of some of
the crypto modules.  On non RedHat systems, you'll probably need kernel
2.4.10 or higher.

4. A non-corrupt kernel source tree.  This seems to fix many reported
problems - starting with a fresh tree, either vendor supplied or from
http://www.kernel.org.  The best test is to build a kernel from your
source tree before patching in Openswan.

				HOW TO INSTALL on Kernel 2.4

1. It's best if you're already installed FreeS/WAN or Super FreeS/WAN 
before, so you'll be familiar with the steps outlined below.

2. For those interested in exactly how we build/install it, the steps are:
 i) 	Uncompress linux-2.4.#.tar.bz2 in /usr/src/linux, build a normal
	working kernel. With recent RedHat kernels (2.4.18+) you will 
	probably need to run "make mrproper" immediately after installing
	the source rpm.
 ii) 	Ensure that your new kernel works before proceeding
 iii) 	In the Openswan source dir:
 	Quick way: "make menugo && make minstall"
 	Step by step way: 
	"make insert && make oldmod && make programs && make minstall" 

				HOW TO INSTALL on Kernel 2.6

For Kernel's 2.6.0 and higher, Openswan uses the built in IPsec support.  Only
the userland component of Openswan is required to use Openswan with a 2.6 series
kernel.


1.	Uncompress openswan-2.0.0.tar.gz
2.	cd openswan-2.0.0
3.	make programs
4.	make install

Note: you will need setkey from the ipsec-tools package, available from 
http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net 


				UPGRADING

1. Just install overtop - it won't replace your /etc/ipsec.* config files

This is work in progress - use a disposable system :/
--------------------------------------------------------

Be aware this requires running a libvirtd to crate the networks
and a qemu/kvm to create the first base image on which all umls
are based.

- Run the usercheck.sh script to see if your user and the qemu user
  are setup properly.

- Ensure the "testing" directory from this tree is world readable.
  including any parent directories. So if this is in your homedir,
  then your homedir needs to be world readable. Or else the /testing
  directory cannot be exported to the VMs

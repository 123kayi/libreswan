Basic pluto test with a variation - the responder has no such policy.

It does have the packetdefault policy, which may cause a problem. Or not.

Paul: I am not sure if this tests anything without oe=yes, which used
      to be the default, so I enabled it. It appears this test is to ensure
      failure. Needs more sanitizing before we can commit known good output

Basic pluto with IKEv2 on the initiator (west), and on the responder,
using RAW RSA keys for authentication.

This test uses nhelpers=0 so all crypto is done inline. In some versions,
this caused the Parent SA state to get immediately deleted upon establishing,
and the Child SA would fail to establish.
